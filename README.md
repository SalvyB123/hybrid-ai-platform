# Hybrid AI Platform (Foundations)

An enterprise-ready, multi-vertical AI assistant platform. This repository starts with the **Foundations (Months 1–2)** phase and grows into the full plan.

## Why this structure?

-   **Simple for a solo builder** now, but **scales** to multiple services later.
-   Keeps AI, API, config, logging, and tests **modular**.
-   **Docs + ADRs** show your decision-making to recruiters and future collaborators.

## Getting started (later steps)

-   Create and activate a virtual env (e.g., `python -m venv .venv`).
-   Install dependencies (we'll add a `pyproject.toml` later).
-   Run lint and tests via `make` (see `Makefile`).

## Database Migrations (Alembic – Async)

We use [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/) for schema migrations, configured for **SQLAlchemy 2.0 async**.

### Common commands

Generate a new migration from models:

```bash
make mig-rev m="add booking table"
```

Apply the latest migrations:

```bash
make mig-up
```

Roll back one step:

```bash
make mig-down s="-1"
```

View migration history:

```bash
make mig-history
```

Check the current migration:

```bash
make mig-current
```

### Where things live

-   Migration scripts: src/db/migrations/versions/
-   Alembic config: alembic.ini, src/db/migrations/env.py
-   SQLAlchemy Base: src/db/session.py

### CI/CD

Our GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs:

```bash
python -m alembic upgrade head
```

before executing tests to ensure the schema is always up to date.

### Roadmap references

See `/docs/roadmap.md` (placeholder) and ADRs in `/adr` for decisions.# trigger ci

## Branching & PRs (modern Git)

We use modern Git commands. Prefer `git switch` for branches and `git restore` for files.
Legacy `git checkout` is equivalent but not used in new docs.

# keep main up to date

git fetch origin
git switch main
git pull --ff-only

# start a task branch

git switch -c feature/<area>-<short-desc>

# commit using Conventional Commits

git add .
git commit -m "feat(<area>): <summary>"

# push and open a PR

git push -u origin feature/<area>-<short-desc>
