# Hybrid AI Platform (Foundations)

An enterprise-ready, multi-vertical AI assistant platform. This repository starts with the **Foundations (Months 1â€“2)** phase and grows into the full plan.

## Why this structure?

-   **Simple for a solo builder** now, but **scales** to multiple services later.
-   Keeps AI, API, config, logging, and tests **modular**.
-   **Docs + ADRs** show your decision-making to recruiters and future collaborators.

```

## Getting started (later steps)

-   Create and activate a virtual env (e.g., `python -m venv .venv`).
-   Install dependencies (we'll add a `pyproject.toml` later).
-   Run lint and tests via `make` (see `Makefile`).

## Branching & PRs (modern Git)

We use modern Git commands. Prefer `git switch` for branches and `git restore` for files.
Legacy `git checkout` is equivalent but not used in new docs.

```
# keep main up to date
git fetch origin
git switch main
git pull --ff-only

# start a task branch
git switch -c feature/<area>-<short-desc>

# commit using Conventional Commits
git add .
git commit -m "feat(<area>): <summary>"

# push and open a PR
git push -u origin feature/<area>-<short-desc>
```
