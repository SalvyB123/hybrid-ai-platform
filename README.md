# Hybrid AI Platform (Foundations)

An enterprise-ready, multi-vertical AI assistant platform. This repository starts with the **Foundations (Months 1â€“2)** phase and grows into the full plan.

## Why this structure?
- **Simple for a solo builder** now, but **scales** to multiple services later.
- Keeps AI, API, config, logging, and tests **modular**.
- **Docs + ADRs** show your decision-making to recruiters and future collaborators.

```

## Getting started (later steps)
- Create and activate a virtual env (e.g., `python -m venv .venv`).
- Install dependencies (we'll add a `pyproject.toml` later).
- Run lint and tests via `make` (see `Makefile`).
